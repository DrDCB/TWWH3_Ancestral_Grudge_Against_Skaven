# Ancestral Grudge Against Skaven
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. A port of my WH2 mod that extends the Dwarf hero and lord skill _Ancestral Grudge_ to work against both Greenskins and Skaven. The original skill is from WH1 before Skaven were in the game and thus only worked against Greenskins, but it was never updated by CA for Mortal Empires or - at least so far - for Immortal Empires either.

The Greenskin element of the skill remains untouched. It has simply been mirrored with the same effect per-tier against Skaven as well. Bonus weapon strength - 15% for heroes, 7%/15% for lords, 15% for runelords.

Should also be compatible with any mod-added heroes/lords that use the vanilla Ancestral Grudge skill.

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853786863). Releases added here to support other platforms.
